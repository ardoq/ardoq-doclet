ardoq-doclet
----

The doclet that let's you automatically add all your JavaDoc and the structure of your Java Application to [Ardoq](http://www.ardoq.com).
If you specify where we can find your classes, with ```-targetClasses ./target/classes``` - we will execute a JDepend analysis as well.

Use it by executing it as a standalone java-application or part of your maven build process.

If you provide a readme.md in your projects root (```projectDir```-argument), it will use that to describe your Workspace in ardoq.

It also supports markdown in ```/* javadoc comments... :-) */```

This doclet will try to as many links and references as it can between methods, classes, interfaces etc, and create corresponding relationships for it as well.
It will try to synchronize existing workspace based on name, and only add or remove packages/components/methods/references that has changed.

**NB! This is an example plugin, that you can fork. It has been used successfully in-house.**

### Example result in Ardoq

####Relationship view in Ardoq
The picture shows how all the relationships between methods, classes, interfaces and so forth are.
Package-references are generated based on the JDepend analysis, and can be filtered in [Ardoq](http://ardoq.com).

####Process view
This picture shows all the found (publicly declared), references for the class SyncUtil.

### Parameters
```
Parameter           | Description
-ardoqToken         | Your token for authenticating with Ardoq (or -ardoqUsername yourUserName / -ardoqPassword yourPass)
-ardoqHost          | Ardoq Server (default https://app.ardoq.com)
-ardoqOrganization  | Your organization ID if you have one (default is ardoq = Personal)
-workspaceName      | The name of the workspace you wish to document in
-projectDir         | The project's root directory where we can find your readme.md
-targetClasses      | If you specify this folder where your compiled classes are, we will run JDepend analysis on your packages.
-sourceControl      | An URL to the location of your Java Source files, e.g. https://github.com/ardoq/ardoq-doclet/tree/master/src/main/java
-subpackages        | Which packages to include
-ignoreMethods      | For large projects, ignore the methods and just add them as documentation to the page
-cacheDirectory     | Which directory to use for caching of information, default is java.io.tmpdir
-cleanCache         | Whether to clean the cache so one does not use old references. Useful in a maven build processes where the first module that everyone uses can clean the cache.
-d                  | The location of your libs e.g. (./target)
-sourcepath         | Java source path (e.g. ./src/main/java)
-exclude            | Which packages to ignore; e.g: java.net:java.lang
-connectionTimeout  | Number of seconds before connection times out (default 15s)
-readTimeout        | Number of seconds before read times out (default 300s)! Some have large workspaces.

### Tags used
* Import pacakages and classes are now also references, and can be filtered via the tags `#ImportedClass` and `#ImportedPackage`.
* References to external java-projects are now tagged as `#ExternalDependecy`.
* Objects that are return values from methods are now tagged as `#ReturnValue`.
* `#Uses` just means that a method or a class uses something
* `#jdepend` Reveals the packages and depencies found from JDepend
* `#parameter`  Means that the object is used as a parameter in a constructor or method

### In your Maven pom.xml
Add the following to your Pom.

```xml
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>ardoq.com</id>
            <url>http://maven.ardoq.com/release/</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
```

Add the following to your reporting section, which will generate new workspace per ```project.name``` and ```project.version```.
It will look for the environment variable ```YOUR_ARDOQ_TOKEN``` to authenticate you.

```xml

Run ```mvn site``` to add your javadoc into ardoq, with JDepend analysis as well. :-)
